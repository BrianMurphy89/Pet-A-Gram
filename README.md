# Pet-A-Gram

Group: Brian Murphy & Shaun Savage

Pet-a-gram - A photo sharing app for your pets.

Technologies used: AngularJS, Node.js, Express, Mongo, Mongoose, CSS

Approach taken:
Our first step was to get together and decide what the app should be. This is where we came up with the idea for Pet-a-gram, a photo sharing app for your pets where users can upload and share photos of their own pets and browse other users' pets. We also brainstormed on some stretch goals, which included adding comments and a location feature that utilizes the Google Maps API. Brian set up the backend routes and structure. We created a couple routes together to test that everything was working before we started splitting up work. At this point we felt the best use of time would be to divide the work between us and Brian took on the styling/css portion while Shaun continued to work on the AngularJS portion. Our original plan was to use routeProvider to navigate the site, but that proved to be more complicated than anticipated and took a lot of time to realize that, so we change gears last minute and used a different approach to show the different views. 


Daily Breakdown:
We would meet daily to discuss the project and what was going well vs where we ran into hangups and the best way to overcome them. Zoom video conferencing and screen share was a vital tool to our daily meetings.

Unsolved Problems:
Delete and Edit routes that are currently working on the app do not update in the browser window without a refresh.

Delete user individual posts not working yet.

Stretch goals of user comments / and google maps integration

Would like to include a show page for each user and most recent posts (a photo feed)
